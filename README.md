# Project 12B: FaunaDB Crud Serverless

This is meant to be a display of a frontend with basic CRUD capabilities via a serverless faunaDB backend. The items here are basic phonebook contacts. Which can be Created, Updated (edited), Read(displayed) and Deleted. All actions update the database as visible by reloading the page.
